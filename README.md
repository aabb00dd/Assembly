# Intel and ARM Assembly Code - School Project

Welcome to my GitHub repository for a school project where I developed code for both **Intel (x86)** and **ARM** architectures. This project showcases basic programs written in assembly language for each platform, created as part of a computer architecture and systems programming course.

## About the Project

This repository includes:

- Intel x86 Assembly programs
- ARM Assembly programs
- Comments and documentation for better understanding
- Example use cases and outputs where applicable

The goal of this project was to learn and demonstrate:

- Low-level programming on different architectures
- Understanding CPU instruction sets
- Writing efficient and functional assembly code
